# PIP
For GPUPlanCache

## Parameter
--polyPath your_polygons_path
--pointPath your_point_path

## Description of polygons_file and points_file
### polygons_file
****************
Example:
2
1
0 3
0 0
0.5 0
0.5 0.5
1
1 4
0.5 0.5
1 0.5
1 1
0.5 1
****************
Polygon files must be provided strictly in the following formatï¼š
- The first line is the total number of polygons.
- Starting from the second line, describe each polygon.
  -- Firstly, using the number 1 to divide different polygons.
  -- Then, provide the ID of the polygon and the number of vertices. Note that the ID of the polygon needs to increase sequentially starting from 0.
  -- Next, provide the horizontal and vertical coordinates of each vertex in each row. Note that the size of each coordinate is between 0 and 1.

### points_file
****************
Example:
0.6 0.6
****************
Provide the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a single point, ranging from 0 to 1.

## Result
****************
Example:
./PIP --polyPath your_polygons_path --pointPath your_point_path
The plan ID is 2
****************
The code will ultimately output the point within which polygon, in the form of the polygon ID.
